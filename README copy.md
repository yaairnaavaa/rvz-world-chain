# Revoluzion üöÄ
Welcome to the official repository for Revoluzion, a decentralized mini-app designed for the World Coin network. Our mission is to empower people to create and support social causes through the power of blockchain technology.

üéØ What is Revoluzion?
Revoluzion is a platform that allows users to launch campaigns for social causes, ranging from local community initiatives to global impact movements. Support for these causes is materialized through the acquisition of special edition NFTs called RVZ Tokens. Each token not only represents a contribution but also grants its holders the ability to participate in the governance and key decisions of the cause they support.

We aim to create a transparent, democratic, and efficient ecosystem where social change is driven directly by the community.

‚ú® Key Features
Cause Creation: Any verified user can propose and launch a campaign for a social cause.

NFT Support: Supporters can back causes by purchasing NFTs (RVZ Tokens), thereby funding their operations and objectives.

Decentralized Governance: RVZ Token holders can vote on important proposals and decisions related to the cause.

Blockchain Transparency: All contributions and expenses are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring full transparency and traceability of funds.

World ID Integration: We leverage World ID's "Proof-of-Personhood" to ensure that each participant is a unique individual, preventing fraud and bots.
